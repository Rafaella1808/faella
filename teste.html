    <p> Transport, motorways and tramlines
Starting and then stopping
Taking off and landing
The emptiest of feelings, disappointed people
Clinging onto bottles
When it comes, it's so, so disappointing
</p>
<p>
Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around
</p>
<p>
Shell smashed, juices flowing
Wings twitch, legs are going
Don't get sentimental
It always ends up drivel
</p>
<p>
One day, I am gonna grow wings
A chemical reaction
Hysterical and useless
Hysterical and
</p>
<p>
Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around
</p>
<p>
Let down and hang
Let down and hang
Let down and hang
</p>
<p>
You know, you know where you are with
You know where you are with
Floor collapses, floating
Bouncing back
</p>
<p>
And one day, I am gonna grow wings
A chemical reaction (you know where you are)
Hysterical and useless (you know where you are)
Hysterical and (you know where you are)
</p>
<p>
Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around
